## About: ðŸ§µ Kalasewa: Cosplay Costume Rental Platform

Developed a rental marketplace platform connecting renters and costume owners, enabling seamless transactions in a user-friendly e-commerce-style experience.

In response to the booming Japanese pop culture scene in Indonesiaâ€”especially anime, manga, and cosplayâ€”Kalasewa was built to bridge the gap between costume enthusiasts and small rental businesses (UMKM). The platform addresses key issues like:

- Lack of transparency in costume rental quality & reviews
- Limited access to affordable costumes due to high purchase prices (Rp300kâ€“3jt)
- Operational pain points for both renters and owners (late returns, damage, missing accessories, etc.)
- The history of the renters is also not much owned by the costume owner, so there is a potential to get a renters who has previously had problems without being known by the owner.

#### Kalasewa Features:

- Role-based access: Owner, Renter, Admin
- Information-rich listings with clear rental terms
- Review system to build trust. Both parties (owner, and renter) can rate each other.
- Admin-managed oversight for user accountability
- Badge System. Users can see how the track record of owners/renter and admins can ban problematic owner/renter accounts.
- Integrated with midtrans
